# Number-plate-recognition-system-using-matlab

It is design by MATLAB R2019A


Adnons requirnment are 

Arduino

Webcam



Hardware requirnment are

Webcam

Arduino Uno

Servomotor( any for barrier opening)

LCD ( 16x2 for status ddisplay)



Designing 

Connect Arduino and Webcam to PC having MATLAB R2019S by USB ports. LCD data pin i-e D4 D5 D6 D7 are connected to arduino's pins D5 D4 D3 D2 respectively, while enable pin to D6 and Register Select to D7 and contrast control to D11(if you havn't any external Variac) and connect servo motor to A0 of arduino and boom.


Deployment

Add path of project to MATLAB and run "number_plate_recognition_system.m" click on "Initialize" button and than "Start" button.
